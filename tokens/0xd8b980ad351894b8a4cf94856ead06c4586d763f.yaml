  BitSense Token is erc20 token based on the Ethereum network. It is the native currency of the BitSense platform.
  It acts as means of exchange of goods and services and as the central point between members and advertisers.
  BitSense is a decentralized platform for advertisers, businesses and members. My vision of BitSense is to create
  a simple ecosystem for everyday users who will be able to earn cryptocurrency/fiat by simply watching daily ads
  or doing simple tasks. Money they will earn will come from the people advertising their business.
